## Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree- Bay Area Bike Share Project

This folder contains files for P0: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data.

*Goal of Project:* 
Use Python to perform steps of the data analysis process on bikeshare trip data collected from the Bay Area Bike Share project. You will write code to clean the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create basic visualizations of the distribution of data.

SLC_Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb - Main project file.

babs\_datacheck.py; babs\_visualizations.py - Supplemental scripts for checking
data wrangling, reporting of basic statistics, and creation of exploratory bar
charts and histograms.

Data is split among twelve other files, organized into three sets of four files
each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for
each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file
indicate contents:

\*\_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

\*\_station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and
capacities.

\*\_trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share
system.

\*\_weather\_data.csv - Weather information by day for one station in each
city in the bike share program.
