# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree- Wrangling & Analyzing Twitter Data

This folder contains the files for the P4. Wrangling & Analyzing Twitter Data Analysis

Goal of Project: The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, 
also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings 
almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? 
Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
